# Unofficial event organisator-s guide for Mozilla Hubs

This guide is not a tutorial or techinal documentation of Mozilla Hubs. Things change fast in Hubs - and VR in general - and maintaining detailed tutorials wouÃ¶d be too big task. Instead, this document tries to give an overview of things one must be aware of when utilisng Hubs for events or public VR spaces.

## Mozilla Hubs
 > take control of your online communities with a fully open source virtual world platform that you can make your own.
 
Mozilla hubs is a browser-based VR platform developed by Mozilla. 

## Why?
You may (and should) wonder what new virtual reality might bring to your event. Is it really worth of extra effort?

### Browser-based virtual reality
The word "immersion" is often attached to virtual reality. If you have ever tried good VR-glasses, ...
But how about VR in browser? There is no such immersion available that VR-glasses can offer. Does it even make sense to speak about virtual reality on browser? 



## Spatial sound

Surprisingly, the most comprehensive aspect of VR is how user sounds are handled. In most VR-systems (including Mozilla Hubs) sound is spatial. This means that sounds behave like in a real world: if someone speaks on my left side, then I hear the sound from my left speaker or headphone. And if someone is screaming far a way from me, I can only hear a faint murmuring.

When I first tried Mozilla Hubs with small group of people, I was annoyed because of spatial sound. We all kept running around virtual space and then tried to speak each other without hearing each other after all. Swithing from video meeting to VR was bad experiense. I kept wondering why spatial sound is used. It did not seem to work, it just made our communication difficult. So, why is it used?


Spatial sound is not a technical requirement of virtual reality, it is purposely built feature. One can think of couple of reasons why spatial sounds are used in VR.

1. Mimicking real world
Like I stated earlier, spatial sound works like sounds in real life. And if one wants to mimic reality, then also the behaviour sounds should mimic reality. But virtual reality does not have to mimic reality but instead one can choose what kind of reality one want. So if spatial sound is not what users want, then there is no reason to use it just because we have to mimick real world.
But there is another reason that justifies the use of spatial sound.

2. Contextualising conversations
What do you do when you go to the museum with someone? In addition to enjoying services of the museum cafeteria, you propably wonder around, watch things and discuss about them with your company. And this is the purpose of spatial sound in VR. It contextualise conversations. It's like saying: "Here, in this corner of virtual space we discuss about this thing hanging on the wall". 

3. Natural grouping
This one is close related to previous one. Spatial sound allows natural grouping of people without the need of breakout rooms. People in groups can have discussions without disturbing another groups and changing group is as easy as moving close to the group of avatars. 



### Ways to deal with spatial sound
Spatial sound is essential part of communication in virtual reality, but sometimes that is not what we want. Let's say you want to organise a meeting with group of people. Then it's desirable that we can have continous sound connection like in a video meeting so we can hear everyone's opinnions. Or maybe we are building the the VR space and we want to be able to discuss during construction. 
There are couple of ways to bypass spatial sound.


#### External audio
External audio means that one use something else than VR application itself for audio connection. For example, users can fist join to Google Meet session and then open Hubs room in a different browser tab with microphone and speakers muted in Hubs room. 
External audio can be achieved also naturally if all participants are physcally in the same room (for example in class room). Then people can speak in IRL and still share the same virtual space.


#### Audio Zones

#### Virtual microphone
Virtual microphone is a special case of audio zone, where there is a special microphone area that 

RULE: If your audience are meant to communicate by speaking, then you must pay great attention to sound design.

If you only want to keep a meeting, then VR might not be the best solution.
