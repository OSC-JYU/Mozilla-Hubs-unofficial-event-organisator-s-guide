# Unofficial event organisator-s guide for Mozilla Hubs

This guide is not a tutorial or techinal documentation of Mozilla Hubs. Things change fast in Hubs and maintaining detailed tutorials wou√∂d be enormous task. Instead this document tries to give an overview of things one must be aware of when utilisng Hubs for events.

## Spatial sound

Surprisingly, the most comprehensive aspect of VR is how user sounds are handled. In most VR-systems (including Mozilla Hubs) sound is spatial. This means that sounds behave like in a real world: if someone speaks on my left side, then I hear the sound from my left speaker or headphone. And if someone is screaming far a way from me, I can only hear a faint murmuring.

When I first tried Mozilla Hubs with small group of people, I was annoyed because of spatial sound. We all kept running around virtual space and then tried to speak each other without hearing each other after all. Swithing from video meeting to VR was bad experiense. I kept wondering why spatial sound is used. It did not seem to work, it just made our communication difficult. So, why is it used?


Spatial sound is not a technical requirement of virtual reality, it is purposely built feature. One can think of couple of reasons why spatial sounds are used in VR.

1. Mimicking real world
Like I stated earlier, spatial sound works like sounds in real life. And if one wants to mimic reality, then also the behaviour sounds should mimic reality. But virtual reality does not have to mimic reality but instead one can choose what kind of reality one want. So if spatial sound is not what users want, then there is no reason to use it just because we have to mimick real world.
But there is another reason that justifies the use of spatial sound.

2. Contextualising converstations
What do you do when you go to the museum with someone? In addition to enjoying services of the museum cafeteria, you propably wonder around, watch things and discuss about them with your company. And this is the purpose of spatial sound in VR. It contextualise conversations.


3. Natural grouping
This one is close related to previous one. Spatial sound allow natural grouping of people, People in groups can have discussion without disturbing another groups. 

### Ways to deal with spatial sound
Sometimes you

#### External audio

#### Audio Zones


RULE: If your audience are meant to communicate by speaking, then you must pay great attention to sound design.

If you only want to keep a meeting, then VR might not be the best solution.
